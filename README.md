# crwn-clothing
An E-Commerce React Project
Crwnclothing is an e-commerce progressive web app for a fictional clothing store. 

A user is able to browse through different categories of clothing and save them to a shopping cart. 

A user can create their own personal accont on the website using an email and password or through a third party authenticator, in this case, Google. 

A secure payment method is included through Stripe. 

A user can simulate a payment with a test credit card upon checkout. 

All security and authentification is managed on the backend through Google Firestore and Stripe. 

The complex state of the application is managed using Redux and Redux Thunk to handle async requests.
